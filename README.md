<h2>Description</h2>
Azure AI services streamline developers' access to Microsoft's scalable infrastructure while they concentrate on their code. To offer more control over service infrastructure and data flow, Azure AI APIs can be containerized, enabling deployment on Azure Container Instances, local Docker servers, or Azure Kubernetes Services clusters. Containerized services retain billing connections to Azure but ensure application data isn't transmitted to the backend, empowering organizations with enhanced setup control for authentication, scalability, and customization.
